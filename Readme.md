# Reflexive Programming

## What is "Reflexive Programming"?

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisici elit, sed eiusmod tempor incidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Nihilne te nocturnum praesidium Palati, nihil urbis vigiliae. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus. Contra legem facit qui id facit quod lex prohibet. Excepteur sint obcaecat cupiditat non proident culpa.

## Reflex Architecture

This should explain the concept of the Reflex Core, which is used by the various Reflex Libraries. 

## Unbounded Objects With ES6 Proxies

Explain how unbounded objects work, and how this is a key element in supporting reflexive programming.

## Reflexive Programming Over Web Interfaces

This paragraph should be an introduction that distinguishes Reflex programming from other libraries like React and Angular. Explain how there's no Virtual DOMâ€“HTMLElement objects are just created and manipulated directly, without having to go through some proprietary abstraction.

- Basic HTML element hierarchy creation.

  - Text content
    - Template literals
    - CSS class names
  - Returning arrays
  - Embedded closures.
  - With generator functions

- Recurrent functions.

  - `on()`, `only()` and `once()`
  - Autorunners
  - Effects & Properties
  - Mutation Effects

- Asynchronous content loading

  - With async iterators
  - With promises

- Data binding

  - Value binding
  - Array synchronization
  - Complex object synchronization

## Reflexive Programming Over Truth Documents

Explain how all the same principles of Reflexive programming can be applied to any structure. Demonstrate how it works when operating over a truth document. Explain how TrueScript backend takes the place of the ML backend in the unbounded object when operating over a truth document.

Explain how the Truth compiler API (or is this Truebase?) can generate various events that contribute to the global `on()` function, to produce events that are specific to the editor.

Explain how the Truth compiler API could be extended to operate under a Reflexive programming model, where the type resolution behavior could be augmented by applying recurrent functions to various points in the compiler.

## Code Severing

Explain how the *ReflexSeverance* library will be a general static analysis tool that will be used to create severances between different Reflexive Trees. So you could create a severance between the Truebase API, and HTML. Or you could create another one between HTML and HTML (for the static and dynamic side of an emitted HTML document).

Explain how severed code relies heavily on the use of source maps to achieve consistent debugging.
